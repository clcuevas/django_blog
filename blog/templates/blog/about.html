  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <h3>In depth...</h3>
  <p>I am a first generation Mexican-American. I was born and raised in Southern California, but moved to Seattle 4 years ago because I enjoy the city's culture, coffee, geography, and weather.</p>
  <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing or watching baseball. Although I support our Seattle Mariners team, my heart still belongs to the blue and red--Angels and Dodgers. I also enjoy hiking the Cascades and when time allows, I pack my day pack and hit the road to our National Forests. I am a strong believer in allowing yourself to unplug from your every day life and technology for a little R&R.</p>
  <h3>Technology</h3>
  <p>I have always had a passion for technology, but never had a mentor throughout my educational career to help me realize it was something I should have pursued rather than a degree in Business Administration. It wasnâ€™t until I moved to Seattle and had the opportunity to work with a few developers that I came to realize my interest and passion to seeing an application going from an idea to a realization. One year away from turning 30, and having 6 successful years in IT support/ administration, I quit my job (and left a promotion) to pursue my dream in some day becoming a successful developer.</p>
  <p>Every individual I have had the pleasure and opportunity to work with will speak of the determination and passion I have for the work I am responsible for. I take great care of the projects I am overseeing, and provide ample support to other business partners I am in communication with. I also consider myself to be a goal-oriented individual. Setting goals and meeting them has been a driving force in my relentless pursuit of education.
  I am a strong believer that all individuals should continually strive to reach their personal best rather than become complacent. There is always a deficit of knowledge in an area that can be gained and can help propel a team/company to solve a problem. <strong><em>It is through education and an expansion in our knowledge that we are given the opportunities and tools to become innovative in what we do</em></strong>.</p>
  <p>In five years from now, I hope to see myself being an integral team member for a company that has given me the opportunity to grow with. I also hope to share my story with a greater audience in hopes that it can help future generations of under privileged kids. I hope to be living proof that our American Dream still lives, that upward social mobility is achieved through hard work.</p>
